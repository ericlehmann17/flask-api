# flask-api
A small web application created using the Flask web framework in Python. Mainly for practice and learning purposes. The application allows a user to pull data from a web api by making queries in the url. Many of the ideas in this project came from an online tutorial: https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-apis-with-python-and-flask

Both the database file and the python file are included in this repo. You have to download all the files to your local machine in order for this to work - the web application runs on your local IP, and the application pulls from the database locally.
