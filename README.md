# flask-api
A small web application created using the Flask web framework in Python. Mainly for practice and learning purposes. The application allows a user to pull data from a web api by making queries in the url. Many of the ideas in this project came from an online tutorial: https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-apis-with-python-and-flask
